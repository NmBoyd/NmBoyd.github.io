{"name":"Nathan Boyd","tagline":"About Me","body":"Hello\r\n\r\nI'm Nathan Boyd, a passionate Robotics engineer who has worked with various mechatronic systems such as Mobile Robots, Drones, Robot Arms, and Legged Robots. My main interest is the study of legged robots and manipulation for complex environments. Typically I don't do research in specific algorithm development and instead try my best to solve the \"system\" problem. Defaulting more toward understanding and implementing existing methods to get something running to solve a difficult problem, rather than coming up with an algorithm with X% better performance (This is why I have a Masters Degree instead of a PhD).\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
